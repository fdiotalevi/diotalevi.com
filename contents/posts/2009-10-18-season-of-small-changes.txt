2009 so far has been quite busy: I've started <a href="http://www.knokode.com">my own company in January</a>, but I haven't been able to do much with it being busy contracting for <a href="http://info.vodafone360.com/">Vodafone</a>. <br/>
Then I had the opportunity to become every month more involved in the OSGi community, first being elected committer of <a href="http://felix.apache.org">Apache Felix</a>, going to ApacheCon and <a href="http://www.osgi.org/DevConEurope2009">OSGi DevCon Europe</a>, then talking with different people and companies interested in applying this technology in their products. <br/>
Finally, I'm getting ready for a busy November when I'll fly to Milano for <a href="http://www.jaxitalia.com">JaxItalia</a> and then to Antwerp for <a href="http://www.devoxx.com">Devoxx</a> in the space of the week. More details on these conferences in future posts (hopefully).
<br/>
Going to the (small) changes of the title: my resolution for the last trimester of 2009 is to limit the consulting work to (at most) 60% of the time, to focus on some product ideas and on expanding my business. Starting from tomorrow, when I'll enjoy my first "free day" since months.

<p>A lot to things to figure out yet: how to organize my time, without strict deadlines and clear requirements, and avoid to waste time surfing the net (and playing Farmville :| ). And how to market my ideas, demos and company.<br/>
A lot of new stuff, interesting stuff though.</p>
