<p>Together with some people met at the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_163895500288173">Italian Startup Scene Facebook group</a> (in italian only, sorry!) we are planning a Customer Development exercise. The rules are simple: pick a project, start (sometime) in January, and work on customer development for 10 weeks.</p>
<p>No big theoretical discussion, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=JFDI">jdfi</a>. Scary eh?</p>
<p>Anyway, while I'm busy pondering my project idea, I wrote down a schedule proposal for this exercise. My main inspiration were of course <a href="http://steveblank.com/">Steve Blank's blog</a> and <a href="http://www.ashmaurya.com/">Ash Maurya</a>'s <a href="http://www.runningleanhq.com/">Running Lean</a>, but I tried to make it more practical as possible.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any comment or correction.</p><!--more-->

<h3>Customer Development in 10 weeks</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Week 1: Fill the Lean Canvas, focus on CPS</strong></p>
<p>Fill the <a href="http://diotalevi.com/2010/10/24/the-lean-canvas/">Lean Canvas</a> with your business hypothesis. In particular, focus on <strong>CPS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer</strong> Segment: who is the target customer?</li>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: what are the customer problems you want to solve</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: whats your proposed solution?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 2: Validate the CPS - Part 1</strong></p>
<p>Reach at least 5 potential customers and</p>
<ul>
<li>understand if they experience the problems you are trying to solve</li>
<li>understand what is the most painful problem they have</li>
<li>understand if your solution fits their needs</li>
<li>understand if your solution is a <em>nice-to-have</em> or a <em>must-have</em>; understand how it couldbecome a must-have solution</li>
<li>understand the minimum feature set of the application to be useful</li>
<li>ask them to introduce you to more potential customers</li>
<li>ask them the permission to follow up with another brief interview in 2 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 3: Validate the CPS - Part 2</strong></p>
<p>Review the results of the interviews done so far, and update the Lean Canvas with your findings. Reach out at least other 5 potential customers and interview them.</p>
<p><strong>Week 4: Review the Lean Canvas, focus on <em>Business Model, Channel, Value Proposition</em></strong></p>
<p>Review again the Lean Canvas. Focus on</p>
<ul>
<li>describing the Business Model. How are you going to make money?</li>
<li>describe the channel: how are you going to acquire new customers? Adsense? Coldcalls? Newspaper ads?</li>
<li>describe your Value Proposition: when you have customer attention, how are you goingto convince them to use the product?</li>
</ul>
<p>In parallel, you might want to create a few screenshots showing how the product is going to work, and how the user will interact with it.</p>
<p><strong>Week 5-6: Validate the Business Model, Channel, Value Proposition</strong></p>
<p>Interview at least 10 potential customers (they might be the ones you already interviewed). Show them the screenshots of the application. Find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the application is useful to them, if it solves their problems</li>
<li>Does it need more/less features to be useful?</li>
<li>Would they use the application if it was free?</li>
<li>How much are they willing to pay. Whats the maximum price?</li>
<li>Whats the best way to reach other customers? Adsense, TV commercials....</li>
<li>Whats the best marketing message to convince potential customers to sign up?</li>
</ul>
<p>Review the Lean Canvas at the end of each week with your findings.</p>
<p><strong>Week 7: Build the landing page/website</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have</p>
<ul>
<li>the approved (by your customers) screenshots of the application</li>
<li>the list of the application features</li>
<li>a marketing message (the Value Proposition)</li>
<li>a business/pricing model</li>
</ul>
<p>you can create a landing page or small website to present your product.</p>
<p>Go back to your potential customers (via email is fine) to ask them to have a look at it, if they like it and if its clear what you are selling.</p>
<p>Dont forget to add a <em>Coming soon</em> message and let the visitors leave their email for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Week 8-9: Build MVP</strong></p>
<p>Build the minimum viable product. (In my opinion) you need to build a working application that covers the minimum feature set that you discussed with your potential customers.</p>
<p><strong>Week 10 - ????: Open private beta</strong></p>
<p>Deploy the MVP and ask your potential customers (the one you interviewed + who signed up in the website) to use it.</p>
<p>During the private beta, you are not looking for growth (in terms of number of users); keep the user number low. Invite only people who are really interested in the product, not just curious about it. You are looking for customer retention and satisfaction.</p>
<p>You measure the retention measuring the number of users who use the service regularly (you have to define what regularly means first).</p>
<p>You measure the satisfaction asking users to <a href="http://survey.io">answer a survey</a>.</p>
<p><em>Only when you have retention and satisfaction you can open the beta to the public</em>. Remember to define a retention goal (i.e. 50% week/week) and satisfaction goal (i.e. 40% extremely satisfied) before opening the private beta.</p>
