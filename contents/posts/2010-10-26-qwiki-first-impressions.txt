<p>Today I received my invitation to signup for the <a href="http://www.qwiki.com">QWiki</a> Alpha, the product that has recently won the <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/2010-sf/">Techcrunch Disrupt</a>; I must confess I couldn't wait to try it, so I went ahead and just tried it:</p>
<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/z4Zv95VdXes?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/z4Zv95VdXes?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

<p><strong>First impressions</strong></p><!--more-->
<ul>
<li>the contents available are already <strong>massive; </strong>they claim to have 2 millions of qwikis already, things that rule out the possibility they're all manually crafting all the entries... there's definitely a lot of automation behind</li>
<li>it's not, as somebody suggested, just a voice over wikipedia; qwikis are fairly short and to the point</li>
<li>the voice is quite good (as good as can a voicesynthesiser can be, which unfortunately is far from perfect)</li>
<li>voice and images are often not perfectly synchronised, but it's a very acceptable first attempt</li>
<li>navigation between qwikis (and to external resources) is still limited</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a very interesting first alpha, and I'm very curious to see how it will evolve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other interesting question is what their business model is going to be.<br/>
The <a href="http://www.qwiki.com/for-publishers">What's Next</a> page lists the first ideas: <strong>personal and professional presentation, dating, shop and restaurants advertisement, real estate</strong>. All interesting fields, but unless they are willing to build their own thematic portals, they would end up being just a feature in some other existing product.</p>
<p>On the other side, at first glance, I can certainly see a use as an entertainment channel: for example as a dedicated channel/application of <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">GoogleTV</a> or in cable TV.</p>
