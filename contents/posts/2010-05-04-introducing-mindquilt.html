	<p>So now that "little guy" (we couldn't find a better name for him) is out, with his shiny new badge, it is probably the right moment to introduce <a href="http://www.mindquilt.com">Mindquilt</a>.</p>
	<p>Mindquilt is the attempt of a few of us to propose an "enterprise" system to make the knowledge flow in an organization agile. The tools we usually use for that can be grouped in two categories:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>documentation based (wiki, word documents): structured documentation, often difficult to find and almost always outdated</li>
		<li>real time (chat, phone): very effective, but intrusive and almost impossible to "capture" in a durable format</li>
	</ul>

	<p>What we are trying to build is a system taking the best of the two worlds. Any user can enter questions into the application; these questions are routed, using an intelligent algorithm, to the company experts in the related topics, that can answer them. And all the information flow is recorded and categorized, so that it can be extracted in what we call "Just in Time documentation".</p>

	<p>Sound interesting? I hope so. For sure it will sound a bit fuzzy right now.</p>

	<p>You can have a look at our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE2rTicVsWk">promotional video</a> for a few more details, or just wait a few more weeks for entering in our private beta.</p>

	<p>And of course, the best way to know more about Mindquilt is <a href="http://launchpad.e2conf.com/vote-now/">to vote us</a> in the Enterprise 2.0 Launchpad, so that we can show it on stage in Boston.</p>

	<p>And you can even use <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/votemindquilt/">our Facebook app</a> to add the coolest badge you've ever seen!</p>
