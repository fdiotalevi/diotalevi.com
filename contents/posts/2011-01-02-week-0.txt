<p><em>Following </em><a href="http://timbull.com/"><em>Tim Bull's example</em></a><em> I'll try to post weekly updates/retrospective on what I'm doing. Hopefully that should help me to keep track of my many activities, and (arguably) it might be of interest of the blog casual reader, since I'll keep working in the startup/web development field.</em></p>
<p><em>Week 0 is not really a retrospective, but a short summary of what I'll start doing from tomorrow.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>After 10 years of Java development, I'm starting my first customer project in Ruby and Rails. I cannot really talk about it that much, but in short it's a prototype for a vertical social network. I'm really looking forward to it</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I still have some time available for consulting projects in the first quarter, since the Ruby contract won't be fulltime. I have three meetings scheduled next week to meet potential customers, but if you have any interesting project, <a href="mailto:filippo@knokode.com">feel free to contact me</a>!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm starting also my project in the Italian <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?&amp;#!forum/customerdevelopercamp">CustomerDevelopmentCamp</a>; I talked about this customer development "study and practice" group <a href="http://diotalevi.com/2010/12/18/customer-development-in-10-weeks/">here</a>. I'm keeping a very detailed diary inside the Google Groups, but I'll republish it here the contents in English</li>
</ul>
