<p>So, many people are asking me for updates, or to have a closer look at <a href="http://www.mindquilt.com">Mindquilt</a>.</p>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-110" title="betamindquilt" src="http://diotalevi.com/http://diotalevi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2010-07-24-at-19.29.27-300x214.png" alt="" width="300" height="214" />

<p>For them, the good news is that our <a href="http://beta.mindquilt.com">beta is live</a> (since more than a month now, actually); the (less good) news is that we are sending out invitations at a slower pace we would like to. It turned out that there are so many activities in running the company (paperwork, marketing, sales, product design, user interface, customer support and plain-old development) that we are constantly overwhelmed by the things to do. We have a plan to improve that anyway! more on that later</p>

<p>So, talking about updates.</p>

<p>The first, long due update, is about our participation in the <a href="http://launchpad.e2conf.com/">Enteprise 2.0 Launchpad</a>; as good ol Ceasar said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veni,_vidi,_vici">we came, we saw, and... we came second</a> (or something like that). <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adunne/4706837928/sizes/l/in/set-72157624252543430/">Daniel went on stage</a> on July 16th to present Mindquilt and, as you can guess from the diabolic grin, he was great. We had good feedbacks and a lot of interest, and 38% of the votes. So close to win.</p>

<p>Of course it hurts a bit to loose for a handful of votes, but we were by far the youngest company in the lot.
Thats the thing I like of my <a href="http://www.mindquilt.com/about">team mates</a>: we are so excited to present our product and compete in startup competitions that we often forget we are competing against companies with 2-3 years of hard work behind, and hundreds or thousands of customers.</p>

<p>Back to Europe, back to coding. We got together in Dusseldorf for a final hackathon before releasing a new beta version. Despite the crazy world cup german days, we were able to release a lot of bug fixes and new features  in the new version, mostly driven by the early feedbacks of our beta and potential customers.
We also set up <a href="http://www.mindquilt.com/blog">a blog where you can gain more insights on Mindquilt</a>.</p>


<p>Shortly after, we participated in the <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/07/16/so-who-won-the-techcrunch-europe-summer-pitch-battle/">Techcrunch Pitch Battle in London,</a> hosted by the new <a href="http://www.techhub.com">TechHub</a>. Again a great experience, we made it to the final 8 but not in the top 3. <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/antongething">Anton</a> was on stage this time, and he did a great job.</p>

<p><b>Whats next?</b> Again, so many things I dont even know where to start.</p>

<p>First thing, we have been selected for the <a href="http://seedcamp.com/pages/london10">Mini Seedcamp London</a>. It will be again Anton turn to present Mindquilt in this <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/07/20/teams-released-for-mini-seedcamp-london/">20-startup-20 competition</a>, with most of the European VCs and angels as judges. The Mini Seedcamp is next tuesday so check <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fdiotalevi">my twitter account for almost-real-time updates</a>.</p>

<p>Code wise, besides the omnipresent bug fixes, the payment integration (via Paypal) is almost ready; I also worked on the back office part to allow us to gather more usage statistics on the product.</p>

<p>The next big topic is enterprise system integration... huge topic, we will as usual go back to our users and potential customers to understand what are the priorities.</p>

<p>Finally, we all realised that Mindquilt is taking us every day more time, and we decided to progressively close our consultancy contracts to work full time on it. <a href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/danieledwardkim">Daniel</a> is already 100% on Mindquilt, and flying back to Austin, TX to take care of business in the USA. I'll also end my long-lasting collaboration with ITHR and Vodafone in 3 weeks to dedicate 1(5)0% of my time to this new venture. Pretty exciting eh?</p>

<p>Im not sure where I'll be based at the moment. Getting a Visa for the USA seems to be very complicated, so I'll probably be based still in Dusseldorf, with frequent flights to Austin.</p>
