	<p>A few people have asked me recommendations for good resources/books on lean startups. That's my list:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steven-Blank/dp/0976470705">Four steps to the epiphany</a> let me say it clearly: this book is boring, badly structured and poorly written. However, it all started here. The Customer Development chapter, in particular, contains the essence of lean startups</li>
	<li><a href="http://leanpub.com/startuplessonslearned">Startup Lessons Learned</a> this book contains all the archive of Eric Ries' blog. A lot of practical experience in applying lean and agile methods in startups</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.custdev.com/">The Entrepreneurs Guide to Customer Development for Tech Startups</a> a sort of cheat sheet to "Four steps to the epiphany". Contains a lot of case studies and summaries the lean startup thinking</li>
	<li><a href="http://leanpub.com/seanellis">Startup Marketing,Unlocking Startup Growth</a> honestly, don't trust any marketeer who doesn't know the work of Sean Ellis</li>
	<li><a href="http://leanpub.com/venturehacks/">The Venture Hacks Bible</a> not directly related to lean startup, but that's a 1100+ page pdf containing everything you need to know</li>
	<li><a href="http://venturehacks.com/pitching">Pitching Hacks</a> the art of pitching explained</li>
	</li>
	</ul>
