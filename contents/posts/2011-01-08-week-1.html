	<p><em>Week 1 of 2010 has been particularly eventful. It seems like everybody woke up after the Christmas break and decided to contact me!</em></p>
	<p><strong>First of all, I finished reading</strong> <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby">Metaprogramming Ruby</a>; more than a book, a great experience! I already suggested it to many people, but if you are interested in Ruby, read it by any mean!</p>
	<p><strong>A few people suggested me new events</strong> to add to my <a href="http://diotalevi.com/2010/12/30/startuptech-events-in-europe-january-march-2011/">Startup/Tech European events list</a>: now is more complete than ever! Have a look at it and choose your events for the first quarter of 2011.</p>
	<p><strong>I've started by Ruby on Rails development contract; </strong>I cannot blog much about that, but I'm having a lot of fun improving my Ruby and Rails skills.</p>
	<p><strong>I've also reached an agreement </strong>for another consulting contract for the first trimester of 2011; it's going to be more a performance and architecture review job than a coding one, but hopefully it will turn out to be interesting.</p>
	<p><strong>Finally, I've had some free hours on Sunday to put together a Trunk.ly Ruby client; </strong>it is still incomplete and possibly buggy, <a href="https://github.com/fdiotalevi/trunkly-ruby">but it's already on GitHub</a>. Give it a try. <a href="http://trunk.ly">Trunk.ly</a> is still a young service, but very promising</p>
