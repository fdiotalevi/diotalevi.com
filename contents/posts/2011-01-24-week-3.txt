<p><em>Two weeks worth of updates today.</em></p>
<p><strong>Three consulting gigs </strong>ongoing: Ruby on Rails work, an architecture/performance review and finally some work on a OSGi SaaS platform. Definitely busy times!</p>
<p><strong>I started to collect </strong>some Ruby and Rails code snippets (and some wiki pages of explanation) at <a href="https://github.com/fdiotalevi/rails-dump">https://github.com/fdiotalevi/rails-dump﻿</a>. Nothing polished, just some code to copy in my next project, or step-by-step tutorials to remember certain solutions. Some things I posted there:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <a href="https://github.com/fdiotalevi/rails-dump/tree/master/better-layout">improved standard layout</a> for Rails projects (the default one is ugly)</li>
<li>a reusable <a href="https://github.com/fdiotalevi/rails-dump/tree/master/wizard">module to create wizard controllers</a></li>
<li>how to <a href="https://github.com/fdiotalevi/rails-dump/wiki/Devise-on-mongoid">setup Devise using mongoid as ORM</a> (and MongoDB, of course)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For my traditional Sunday project, </strong>I decided to write a minimal blog engine in Ruby. I'm definitely sick of the terrible service offered by my current hosting provider (<a href="http://servage.net">Servage</a>), and have always played with the idea of writing something simple I can customise to my needs.</p>
<p>After getting the final inspiration looking at <a href="https://github.com/cloudhead/toto">Toto</a> and <a href="https://github.com/karmi/marley">Marley</a>, I wrote a minimal <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>-based (and Git backed) blog engine in 4 hours last Sunday. Deployed on Heroku, it's a 0-cost solution (because you can deploy it using the free plan), runs on a fast server and it's a completely customisable blog. I need some more time to add a couple of other features (in particular, a RSS feed), but it's already deployed <a href="http://fdiotalevi.heroku.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, I started to define my idea for the Bruxelles Startup Weekend. </strong>It's one of my many ideas to improve the way people travel... more details in a few days.</p>
