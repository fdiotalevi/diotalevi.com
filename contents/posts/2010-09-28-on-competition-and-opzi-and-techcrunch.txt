<p>When you woke up in the morning and you find no less than 5 emails asking you to have a look at a link, you usually have to be worried. That's the link <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/opzi-a-quora-for-the-enterprise/">Opzi: A Quora for the Enterprise</a>. (btw, thanks for sending me the link!)</p>

<p>So, as of today, it seems that <a href="http://www.mindquilt.com">Mindquilt</a> has an official competitor. And a powerful one! for many reasons</p>
<ul>
	<li>it's backed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Conway">Ron Conway</a> (through SV Angel), arguably the most successful angel all-time</li>
	<li>... and by many other angels (also <a href="http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/">Paul Bucheit</a> of Gmail's fame, the closest thing to my-personal-hero), for a 1M$ total seed round</li>
	<li>it's a <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a> company</li>
	<li>they managed to go on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/">Techcrunch</a> and <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/2010-sf/">Disrupt</a> even before launching</li>
</ul>

<p>So should I be worried? That was my shower time question.</p>

<p>Certainly <a href="http://www.opzi.com">Opzi</a> is going to jump in the market aggressively. They have a lot of connections in the industry, and they managed to have such a big press release without revealing the product to the general public. That's something that we haven't been able to do that well, even if our product is out since months and we already have customers.</p>

<p>However, the more I think about it, the more I realise that it's actually a good thing.</p>

<p>The reality is, even if there is really a small number of "Enterprise Q&A" platforms out there, there's a lot of competition. </p>

<p>Pretty much every knowledge management software (consider also wikis, collaboration tools, forums, ...) offers a solution to the <a href="http://www.mindquilt.com/archives/257">knowledge transfer</a> problem. The problem is, how do you convince/educate customers that a Q&A platform is better than a wiki/forum/anytool to solve this problem? </p>

<p>That's hard. There's a lot of effort there. Talking to each and every (potential or real) customer, getting their feedbacks and doubts, improving/clarifying/simplifying  the software. I'm glad Opzi will start to work on that with us.</p>

<p>Than there's the advantage of having another player to compare us with. So far, besides the obvious <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>, <a href="http://www.vark.com">Aardvark</a> and <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a> (all consumer products), we haven't had any similar enterprise Q&A player to compare with. </p>

How do you address privacy concerns inside the company (divisions/departments/management/confidential-questions)? <br/>
How do you connect with other enterprise platforms?<br/> 
How do you "map" a question and answer platform with business processes?<br/>
How do you make your system "learn" from previous knowledge?<br/>
How do you spread your product virally, without losing your "enterprise" nature?<br/>

<p>We've found our answers to all these problems, and coded them in Mindquilt. But they're not necessarily the best answers; there's a lot of trial and error there. It will be interesting to learn about Opzi's answers.</p>

<p>Finally, that's a validation of the idea <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/danieledwardkim/">Daniel</a> and I had almost a year ago. There're a lot of solutions to the knowledge transfer problem out there, but they're all sub-optimal. You can have all the documentation, wiki pages, knowledge base in your company, but the most natural way for people to access this knowledge is by asking questions. And the most straightforward way to solve the problem, is to answer those questions.</p>

So, all in all, it's good to see Opzi coming out. Very curious to see their product live.
